# TOOFA
The Object Oriented Footy App

[Status: Temporarily Abandoned]

Writing this serves two purposes:
- It will help me keep track of the money at my 5-a-side Football Club. (I'm the "treasurer" and I'm useless at it...)
- It's an attempt to write something in a strict, "real" Object Oriented style. (See Yegor256, Dave West's "Object Thinking", Alan Kay etc.)
